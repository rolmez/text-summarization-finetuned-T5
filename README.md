# XSum Finetuning with T5 Model

This notebook demonstrates the finetuning process of the T5 model on the XSum dataset for abstractive summarization. It includes code for training the model, evaluating results, and using the finetuned model for inference. Follow the provided steps to understand, train, and leverage the power of T5 for summarization tasks.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the provided Python notebook ('text-summarization-with-t5.ipynb') to train the model on XSum dataset.
3. Check the training results.
4. Load the finetuned model for inference using the provided code snippet.
